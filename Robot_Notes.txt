Data types used in the code:

int8_t - integer variable from (-127, 127)
uint8_t - integer variable from (0, 255)
int16_t - integer variable from (-32767, 32767)
uint16_t - integer variable from (0, 65535)
float - decimal variable from (-3.4028e38, 3.4028e38)
double - same as float on Arduino

floats take a lot longer to process on the Arduino than decimal numbers, and take up more memory.
For example, int8_t or uint8_t each take 1 byte while float takes 4 bytes.
It is thus better to use integer numbers whenever possible. That is why the code uses millimeters
and milliradians instead of meters and radians. For example, 180 degrees is 3.142 rad, but 3142 millirad.
